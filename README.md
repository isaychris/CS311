A thorough understanding of several advanced methods for
implementing the abstract data types and the time used by each
method. Includes abstract data types such as dictionary, priority queues,
matrices, and relations, foundation of recursive algorithms, complexity
analysis, complexity classes, sorting and searching, computability and
undecidability, problem-solving strategies, heuristic search, modeling
and components of database systems, and graphics software systems.
